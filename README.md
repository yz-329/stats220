# Start of STATS220

This github repo will contain all projects done in STATS220 in 2024 Semester 1.


### Project 1
Both a static and animated meme is created using R and Rstudio for this project using mainly the magick package.
Image processing functions are explored and creativly combined together to generate a meme in gif format including:
* *image_append()*
* *image_animate()*
* *image_morph()* etc.



There is also *learning beyond the coursebook*, for example:
1. Research in how to change transperancy of an image.
2. Explore syntax of markdown. [A basic reference guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)


A [reflection webpage](project1_report.html) is also contained in this project using **Rmd**.
